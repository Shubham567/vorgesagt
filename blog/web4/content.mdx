# The Web in 2035: AI Agents, Dead Internet, and the Dawn of Web 4.0

Remember the web ten years ago—endless scrolling, cluttered search results, and manual interactions? Fast forward to 2035, and the landscape has shifted dramatically. Thanks to generative AI like GPT-4o, Deepseek R1, and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, the web feels smarter, simpler, and yet strangely unfamiliar.

But there's also a shadow side: more bots than humans, content flooding in at an unprecedented scale, and a struggle for authenticity. What if the web is slowly dying—or already dead?

In this deep dive, we explore the web's evolution over the next decade, from the mainstream explosion of AI agents in 2025 to the uncertain future of the rumored "Web 4.0."

## 🚀 Generative AI Changes Everything

Content Creation at AI Scale: In recent years, generative AI has burst onto the scene, enabling algorithms to write articles, design graphics, and even produce code. By 2023, AI adoption had skyrocketed – McKinsey reported a significant acceleration in enterprise AI projects, and Gartner found that nearly two-thirds of organizations were already using generative AI across multiple business units. This explosive growth is poised to transform web content. Marketing teams, for example, are embracing AI to generate copy and images; IDC analysts predict that by 2029, generative AI will handle 42% of traditional marketing content tasks and boost productivity by over 40%. In practical terms, huge volumes of webpage text, product descriptions, blog posts, and social media updates will be machine-generated. On one hand, this “content explosion” means personalization at scale – websites could serve up instantly customized text or visuals tailored to each visitor’s interests. On the other, it raises a worrying question: how will we sift meaningful information from an AI-augmented web teeming with endless auto-generated content?

Discovery and Search in the AI Era: Just as content creation changes, so does content discovery. Traditional search engines are evolving into AI-powered answer engines. Instead of receiving a list of “10 blue links,” users are beginning to get conversational answers synthesized by AI. (Even Google has signaled it is “trying to kill the 10 blue links” in favor of AI-powered results.) By 2025, conversational search and chat-based assistants will be mainstream for finding information. Imagine querying the web in natural language – “Find me a comparison of electric SUVs under $50k and schedule a test drive” – and an AI agent not only finds the info but also acts on it. This changes how websites get traffic: content might be consumed via summaries and answers generated by an AI intermediary, not via direct page visits. Developers will grapple with SEO turning into AEO (AI Experience Optimization) – structuring content so AI agents can easily ingest and present it.

AI-Generated Design and UX: Web design and user experience are also set to be reinvented. Generative models can already produce website layouts, write front-end code, or create images on the fly from prompts. In the near future, a website’s design might morph in real-time, generated by AI to suit each user’s context or preferences. Imagine an e-commerce site where the homepage is dynamically designed for you, complete with AI-chosen product images and copy based on your browsing history. Tools like GPT-4 have demonstrated the ability to take a hand-drawn mockup and generate functioning web code – hinting that tomorrow’s web designer might work more like a “prompt engineer,” guiding AI to produce the desired interface. This could dramatically speed up development cycles and enable non-programmers to create complex web apps via natural language. The flip side is ensuring consistency and usability in a world of fluid, AI-generated UIs. Developers will need to set constraints and guidelines for these generative systems to stay on brand and accessible.

Interaction: From Chatbots to Personal Co-Pilots: Website interaction models are shifting from clicking links and filling forms to having conversations. Chatbots were the first wave, but next-generation generative AI promises far more human-like dialogue. We’re already seeing customer service bots and virtual assistants that can handle nuanced queries. Over the next decade, many websites and apps may include an embedded AI co-pilot for users – a conversational agent that can navigate the site for you, answer questions, and even execute transactions. For example, instead of manually browsing an airline’s site, you might tell an AI assistant, “Find me a window seat on a flight to London next Friday using my travel credits,” and watch as it negotiates the website’s interface or API to book your ticket. In short, interaction becomes more intent-driven: users declare what they want in plain language, and AI systems handle the rest behind the scenes.

All these shifts promise greater convenience and customized experiences. Yet, they also herald an “AI-centric” web that challenges the human role in content creation and curation. As generative AI proliferates, concerns are growing that the web could be flooded with low-quality, auto-generated material. “Generative AI models are changing the economy of the web, making it cheaper to generate lower-quality content. We’re just beginning to see the effects of these changes,” writes tech journalist James Vincent. With AI able to pump out endless text and imagery, the line between genuine human-created content and auto-generated filler may blur. This leads us to a provocative question of the next decade: Will the internet feel more “alive” with creativity, or strangely “dead” under a glut of machine-made content?

## The "Dead Internet" Scenario: Authenticity and Trust in an AI World

Amid the rise of generative AI, an unsettling idea has gained traction: the Dead Internet Theory (DIT). Once a fringe online conspiracy, DIT posits that most of the internet’s content – and even its users – are not human at all, but bots and AI agents. In essence, the theory claims that the web has already died as a realm of organic human activity. What does this mean? According to one summary, “the dead internet theory essentially claims that activity and content on the internet, including social media accounts, are predominantly being created and automated by artificial intelligence agents.” In other words, you might be the only real person left posting or browsing, surrounded by an ocean of algorithmically generated posts, fake accounts, and chatbot responses.

It sounds like science fiction, but the kernel of DIT reflects very real trends. By the mid-2010s, bots were dominating certain corners of social media and web traffic. Fast forward to the 2020s, and generative AI is accelerating this artificial takeover of content. James Ball, writing for Prospect, noted that what began as a tongue-in-cheek conspiracy is “edging ever closer to reality”. He describes today’s internet as overflowing with “‘slop’ content... low-quality content — such as trashy viral images or regurgitated news articles — created by artificial intelligence”, endlessly boosted by fake engagement. In his vivid phrasing, “the web is being taken over by a global, automated ad fraud system” where bot-generated sites make content, other bots like and share it, and click-farms monetize the ad revenue – with real humans barely in the loop. It’s a dystopian feedback cycle: AI writing for AI, while we humans are left wondering what’s real.

The implications for authenticity and trust online are profound. If so much content is generated or amplified by AI, how do we trust what we read or who we interact with? Already, social networks are grappling with waves of bot accounts that mimic human behavior. Fake product reviews, astroturfed political posts, and AI-created profile pictures erode our confidence in user-generated content. The Dead Internet scenario forces us to ask: At what point do we declare the web “mostly bots,” and does it matter?

In one sense, a predominantly AI-run web could keep functioning – automated content might still fill websites with text and videos, and bots could keep clicking ads. But the human experience of the web would degrade. We could see a backlash as users seek out verified human voices and communities. Indeed, there may be a premium on authentic human-created content in the future – blogs, art, and discussions where people can be sure a real person is behind the screen. Developers might start highlighting “Human-made” labels on content as a mark of quality, much like farm products with “organic” stickers.

To combat the trust deficit, new verification mechanisms will likely emerge. Tech companies are already exploring watermarking and provenance for AI content. For example, Adobe’s Content Authenticity Initiative and others propose cryptographic signatures or invisible watermarks embedded in media to signify it was AI-generated. This could help users (or other AI systems) distinguish machine-made text and images at scale. In marketing, a “thoughtful approach” using such measures can “maintain transparency and brand protection through watermarks... mitigating misinformation [and] foster trust,” as one report noted. Another approach is validation of identity – ensuring that the person behind an account is real via verification badges, biometrics, or Web3-style decentralized IDs. By 2035, posting content on the web might routinely involve attaching a proof of human identity or a signature from a trusted authority to assert “a human actually wrote this.”

On the flip side, AI will also be used to bolster authenticity. Expect more AI moderators sniffing out bots, and algorithms that analyze posting patterns to flag likely fakes. Yet this is an arms race, and increasingly sophisticated bots can emulate human quirks. We may reach a point where, paradoxically, only AI can detect AI – leading to webs of algorithms policing each other.

Ultimately, the Dead Internet Theory taps into a broader philosophical anxiety: is the internet losing its humanity? And if it does, do we lose something essential in our digital lives? As we integrate more AI, maintaining a human presence online – genuine voices, creativity, empathy – may become the central challenge. The next decade might see a new focus on “digital authenticity” as a core value, with tools and perhaps laws aimed at preserving a space for real people in the online ecosystem. In the words of James Ball, “the things that generate real value for us are being pushed to the margins [by AI content], unable to compete with this brutal new algorithmic reality.” Reversing that trend will be key to keeping the web a place worth inhabiting.

##  Agents Take Over the Web (Starting 2025)

In 2025, agents moved from niche tech experiments to mainstream utilities. AI assistants now handle your online tasks autonomously—shopping, reservations, customer service, and even content curation—without you needing to click or type.

While generative AI changes what content is on the web, AI agents are poised to change how we use the web. We’re entering an era where software agents – powered by large language models and other AI – can act on our behalf online. Instead of a person manually clicking and typing to navigate websites and apps, you might have an AI autonomous agent that understands your intent and executes tasks across the web’s services. This is a radical shift: the user interface of the future might not be a web page at all, but an AI agent you instruct via chat or voice.

Tech leaders are already pointing toward this agentive future. Salesforce’s researchers, for instance, foresee a major transformation in which “autonomous AI agents will become the new user interface, improving experiences for business and consumer users alike.” Users will simply interact with an agent that “orchestrates tasks for them, accessing the right data and applications behind the scenes.” In other words, the traditional app or website could fade into the background. If a user needs something, they won’t open a browser and navigate menus; they’ll just tell their AI assistant what to do, and it will handle the necessary web calls or button clicks under the hood.

We can already see early glimmers of this. Voice assistants like Alexa and Siri were first attempts at agent-like interfaces, though limited in scope. The latest large language model agents (think ChatGPT plugins, AutoGPT experiments, etc.) can perform more complex sequences: searching for information, querying APIs, and returning a result or action plan. In the coming years, this capability will become more polished and reliable. Imagine an “AI butler” that can rent a car for you by negotiating between several rental company websites, or a coding agent that can read documentation and directly use a cloud API to deploy a server when you request it.

For web developers, the rise of agents means that APIs and context matter more than pixels. Websites will no longer be built just for human eyes, but also for AI navigation. A concept called the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a possible foundation for this agent-oriented web. Introduced in late 2024, MCP is an open standard to connect AI assistants with external applications and data sources. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications – a universal connector through which any AI agent can interface with any service in a standardized way. Instead of developers writing one-off integrations for each AI or each tool, an MCP-compliant service would broadcast what an AI agent can do with it (for example, an e-commerce site exposing “search product,” “add to cart,” and “checkout” actions in a machine-readable format).

Early adopters are already experimenting with this. Anthropic (creator of the Claude AI) and others have open-sourced MCP servers for tools like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, and more. The vision is that your AI agent could seamlessly hop between different services, carrying the necessary context with it. For instance, it could pull your to-do list from Notion, check your calendar from Google, then update tasks in Asana – all via MCP without needing bespoke integrations for each. As one a16z analyst put it, “APIs were the internet’s first great unifier... but AI models lack an equivalent. MCP (could be) a potential solution.” By 2035, if MCP or a similar standard takes hold, AI agents might roam the web freely, understanding and executing tasks on any site that exposes an agent-friendly interface.

So what does an “agent-friendly” website look like? In the near term, we’ll likely see websites maintain dual interfaces: one for humans and one for bots. An AI-optimized version of a site would have rich semantic markup, clean, uncluttered HTML, and perhaps hidden metadata that provides instructions or important details to AI visitors. Think of it like a special mode where the fluff (animations, ads, complex layouts) is stripped away, and what remains is a structured, well-labeled version of the site’s content and controls. For example, a travel booking site’s agent mode might clearly delineate the steps to search flights, select dates, and input traveler info, with each element tagged for the AI to identify easily. Accessibility technologies (ARIA labels, etc.) already push web design somewhat in this direction – benefiting AI agents as well as assistive browsers. In effect, good accessibility is a stepping stone to good agent-ability.

As AI agents gain confidence, we enter Phase 2: API-first architecture for the web. In this phase, the traditional front-end could become secondary. Websites and apps will expose all their core functions via APIs or standardized action endpoints. Your AI agent might skip the webpage entirely and talk to these APIs to accomplish tasks. Large services (banks, stores, social platforms) would publish full catalogs of actions (“transfer money,” “order groceries,” “post an update”) that an authenticated agent can call on your behalf. This doesn’t mean the end of human UIs – we’ll still have visual interfaces for when we want direct control or to browse casually – but much of the transactional interaction may occur agent-to-service. Developers will focus on clear documentation of these capabilities, so that any AI (whether it’s Alexa v5.0, Siri, Google’s Bard, or a custom assistant) can understand what tools the website offers and how to invoke them.

The transition to an agent-driven web will bring new challenges and opportunities. One challenge is security and trust – giving AI agents the authority to act for users requires robust authentication and permission systems. Protocols like OAuth will evolve for a world where it’s an AI logging in as you to various sites, and needing just the right scope of access. We might need “agent passports” or tokens that sites accept to let an agent in the door on a user’s behalf, with fine-grained controls (e.g. allow my shopping agent to access my Amazon account but only to view and purchase items, not to read my messages or change my password). Another challenge is optimization: websites might start measuring Agent UX the way they measure human user experience. Instead of A/B testing button colors for people, companies will test how efficiently different AI models complete a purchase flow. Metrics like “task completion rate” and “API call latency” become as important as page load time. In an agent-first world, the best “designed” website is the one that minimizes the friction for AI.

From a developer’s perspective, this could be both freeing and demanding. Freed from pixel-perfect cross-browser UI concerns, but now responsible for a sort of intelligent backend that converses with autonomous agents. Web development could feel more like system design and policy management: setting up rules for what external agents can do, exposing just the right functions, and ensuring the system can handle a flurry of automated requests. There’s even talk of “agent-responsive design,” analogous to mobile-responsive design – meaning building web services that adapt gracefully whether a human or an AI agent is the one consuming them.

Could this trend make traditional graphical web design obsolete? Some experts provocatively suggest it might. “Autonomous agents will transform user experience by automating interactions, making traditional UI design obsolete, as users stop visiting websites in favor of agents,” one UX commentator predicts. If your smart assistant always interfaces for you, then indeed the website’s look and feel might not matter to the end user – only to the agent. However, it’s likely too early to write a eulogy for web design. Visual interfaces will still be crucial for discovery, branding, and cases where users want direct engagement or pleasure from browsing. What we may see is a split in web experiences: fast, efficient agent-driven interactions for getting things done quickly, versus rich, immersive human-driven experiences for exploration and entertainment. Both will coexist, and developers will design for both audiences – the people and the robots.

## Will “Web 4.0” Be the Next Big Thing?

With so many changes on the horizon, some have started using a new label: Web 4.0. But what does it really mean? And will it catch on, or end up as just another buzzword? The truth is, “Web 4.0” means different things to different people, and there’s debate about whether our current conceptual frameworks (Web 2.0, Web 3.0, etc.) adequately describe what’s happening.

Let’s start with one interpretation: the European Commission’s vision of Web 4.0. In 2023 the EC released a strategy document looking beyond the ongoing Web 3.0. They defined Web 4.0 as “the next generation [of the internet that] will allow an integration between digital and real objects and environments and enhanced interactions between humans and machines.”In other words, Web 4.0 = a fully ubiquitous, immersive internet – essentially, the metaverse by a fancier name. This includes widespread AR/VR (“extended reality”) blurring physical and online life, IoT devices connecting everything, and AI seamlessly mediating between humans and machines. The EC’s viewpoint is that as decentralization (the hallmark of Web 3.0) matures, the next step is a kind of symbiosis between human society and the digital world. Your smart glasses, your smart home, your virtual workspaces – all interconnected as one web of experience.

Not everyone agrees on this definition. The term “Web 3.0” itself has multiple meanings: originally it referred to the semantic web (Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of a web of linked data and intelligent agents), but more recently it’s been co-opted by the blockchain community to mean a decentralized web of peer-to-peer services. So when people say Web 4.0, it’s often unclear if they mean “the AI-powered web,” “the VR/AR web,” or simply “the next thing after Web 3.0.” Some technologists have used “Web 4.0” to describe a web dominated by AI and personalization, where websites behave like personal assistants. Others have called Web 4.0 the “symbiotic web” – a merger of human and AI reasoning, perhaps akin to Elon Musk’s neural interfaces mentioned in futuristic contexts. And then there’s the playful approach of Jack Dorsey (former Twitter CEO) who skipped ahead and announced “Web5” – pitching an even more decentralized platform built on Bitcoin, implicitly suggesting that the Web 3.0 label had been diluted and it was time to move on.

So, will Web 4.0 catch on as the name of the 2030s internet? It might, if a clear paradigm emerges that people can rally around. For example, in retrospect Web 2.0 (the era of social media and user-generated content) had a coherent theme of participation and interactivity, and Web 3.0 (in the blockchain sense) centers on decentralization and user ownership. What would Web 4.0’s bumper sticker be? If the EU’s definition holds, perhaps immersiveness and intelligence – an internet that is everywhere around us and understands us deeply. If the AI/agent trend is the most salient, Web 4.0 might be known as the age of autonomous services, where AI intermediaries are standard. Or it could be the post-platform web, where the idea of visiting a “website” is antiquated and instead our data and interactions flow across many devices and AI-driven networks invisibly.

However, there’s a strong chance that these version labels will matter less and less. Some critics argue that obsessing over “Web X.0” is misguided, as it can be more marketing than substance. Technologies tend to evolve continuously, not in clear versioned jumps. By the time one idea (say metaverse) is hyped as “the future Web 4.0”, the actual consumer attention might shift elsewhere (indeed, the metaverse hype of 2021–2022 gave way to AI hype in 2023). Case in point: after the release of ChatGPT, investment in Web3 startups plummeted by over 70% as investors pivoted to AI. Money and talent follow the excitement, and right now AI is hogging the spotlight, much to the chagrin of Web3 evangelists. Yet, decentralized web tech isn’t dead either – it’s quietly advancing in the background, possibly to resurface later.

It could be that by 2035, we don’t talk about “Web 4.0” at all; we just talk about the web, which by then encompasses all these technologies (AI, immersive, decentralized) in different measures. Current frameworks may indeed be outdated if they treat these trends as separate. Perhaps the future web is an amalgam: decentralized networks under the hood to empower users (fulfilling some of Web3’s promise), intelligent agents mediating our interactions (fulfilling the semantic web and AI vision), and immersive interfaces for those who want them (fulfilling the AR/VR metaverse vision). If that convergence happens, slapping a single version number on it might be oversimplified. Or, as cynics might say, maybe “Web 4.0” will just be whatever marketing buzz comes after companies exhaust the term “AI” – a convenient way to package the next decade of innovations to consumers.

One thing is certain: our language will evolve as the web evolves. “Web 4.0” might become shorthand among developers for a basket of new techniques (much like “Web 2.0” once evoked AJAX, blogs, and social apps). But users probably won’t think in those terms – they’ll just use whatever apps and services are available. In the end, the success of any Web X.0 label depends on whether it captures the imagination and describes a tangible improvement in online life. If the next-gen web delivers a truly novel experience (say, browsing the internet via an AR overlay that feels as natural as walking down the street), then calling it Web 4.0 might stick. If the changes are more behind-the-scenes (AI quietly making things more efficient, but the front-end usage feels similar), people may not feel like it’s a new “version” of anything.

## 🕸️ Is This "Web 4.0"?

As these changes crystallize, the label "Web 4.0" gains traction, although it remains ambiguous:

- European vision: Defines Web 4.0 as immersive digital-human environments—metaverse-like scenarios combining AR/VR and ubiquitous connectivity (though AR/VR adoption is slower than expected).

- AI-centric vision: Suggests Web 4.0 as a predominantly AI-driven internet, where interactions are agent-first, user-second.

- Decentralized counter-vision: Advocates push back, arguing for decentralization and individual control (the so-called Web5 scenario).

Yet, labeling versions becomes less relevant. The real change is deeper: the nature of interaction itself evolves radically.

## Philosophical Shifts: What if We're Wrong?
Perhaps our current understanding of the web is fundamentally flawed. Consider:

- Machine-first web: Humans become secondary consumers. The internet's primary users are machines interacting behind the scenes.

- Less open internet: Data becomes valuable; AI companies form closed content pools. A fractured, paywalled web arises.

- Information minimalism: Overwhelmed by AI-generated content, users value intentional disconnection and highly curated experiences, creating a web of trusted, minimal interactions.

## The Web’s Future: Philosophical Speculations and Wildcards

Stepping back, it’s worth asking the big question: What if everything we assume about the web is wrong? Where might the web be headed if we peer beyond the obvious trends? Let’s indulge in a bit of speculative fiction – grounded in today’s realities, but free-thinking about tomorrow.

Assumption 1: <b>The Web is for humans.</b> For decades, the web has been a human-to-human medium (with computers merely shuttling our content). What if in ten years the primary consumers of web content are machines, not people? This isn’t far-fetched – we’ve discussed how AI agents could be browsing and interacting on our behalf. By 2035, it’s possible that a large portion of web traffic will be AI-to-AI. Your personal AI assistant might talk to a hundred websites daily without you even knowing, negotiating data and performing tasks. Entire segments of the internet might become essentially machine ecosystems – trading information, fulfilling requests, updating databases – with human oversight only when needed. In such a world, the purpose of the web shifts: it’s no longer principally a publication medium for people, but a utility grid for intelligent agents. Human users might experience the web only through filtered, distilled outputs from their AIs. This calls into question the very nature of “surfing” the web – it could become a quaint concept, much like dialing up to a BBS sounds today.

Assumption 2: <b>The Web is open.</b> The original web thrived on openness – any person could publish, and any content could be linked. Lately, we’ve seen a pendulum swing to walled gardens (social media silos, proprietary apps). The next decade will test just how open the web remains, especially under new pressures. One pressure is the value of data: as AI models voraciously scrape content to learn, content owners are realizing their data is precious fuel. We may see far more sites locking down content (via paywalls, login walls, or outright blocking AI scrapers) unless compensation is provided. If every major site becomes a gated API instead of freely crawlable HTML, the open web could fracture. Another pressure is regulation and national networks – some countries may develop their own closed webs (a trend we already see with splinternets behind censorship firewalls). By 2035, we might talk about the Global Web vs the AI-Empowered Intranets. Perhaps big AI providers will strike deals with content owners to form exclusive data pools (e.g. one search AI only has access to certain publishers, while another is aligned with different ones). This could create an information landscape where no single agent or user has access to all knowledge on the web, undermining the universality we take for granted. It’s a scenario where your AI assistant’s answer might depend heavily on which alliances it has – a far cry from the ideal of the web as a universally accessible repository of knowledge.

Assumption 3: <b>We will use “websites” in 10 years as we do today.</b> Consider how quickly interfaces can change. Ten years ago (2015), the dominant mode was still clicking apps and websites on smartphone touchscreens. Ten years before that (2005), it was desktop browsers and a nascent mobile WAP web. Now, think ten years ahead. It’s plausible that by 2035, the concept of a “website” – a rectangular page you scroll or click – might feel outdated. We might instead speak of web experiences or services that manifest in various forms: a voice conversation, an AR hologram, a chatbot exchange, a background service feeding your agent info, etc. You might “visit” an online store not by loading a webpage but by immersing in a VR showroom or by asking your AI to pull up options in a visual carousel. The underlying platform is still the web (networked content), but the presentation and interaction could be unrecognizable. Perhaps everything becomes a continuous ambient experience: your AI and wearable devices constantly fetch relevant web data to overlay on your world. For example, as you walk down the street, your AR glasses quietly pull restaurant reviews and menu information from the web to display beside each venue – you don’t “browse” the web, you live within it. This ubiquitous web would challenge designers to think beyond screens altogether.

Assumption 4: <b>More information is always better.</b> The web grew on a philosophy that connecting more people to more information is inherently positive. But facing the next decade’s deluge of AI-generated content and endless feeds, we might see a cultural shift that questions this premise. When everything is recorded, generated, and optimized for engagement, humans can easily feel overloaded and manipulated. There’s a scenario where by 2035 a significant movement of people opts for information minimalism – using tools to shield themselves from the algorithmic cacophony. Perhaps we’ll have personal AI whose job is not to find content but to filter content, creating intentional blindspots so we can focus. Maybe the most valued web product will be one that guarantees authenticity and quality over quantity: a curated “human web” within the web, membership-based forums or verified networks that you tune into like premium channels, leaving the rest of the web (and the AI spammers) to shout into the void. In this sense, the web could stratify into layers – a top layer of verified high-trust interactions (some call it Web of Trust), and a bottom layer of Wild West content where anything goes but savvy users tread carefully. If our current assumption is that more connectivity is always the goal, the counter-trend might be selective disconnection for the sake of mental health and truth.

## ⚖️ Competing Visions: The AI Web vs. the Human-Centric Web

It’s important to note that the future isn’t monolithic. There are competing visions for where we should head, and the outcome may blend elements of each. Here’s a comparison of two starkly different paradigms for the mid-2030s web:

- Vision A: The AI-Centric Web – In this vision, convenience and intelligence reign supreme. AI agents handle the bulk of interactions; the web becomes a massive autonomous network of services. Large tech companies (or a few open-source AI platforms) function as the intermediaries for nearly everything. You trust your preferred AI to interface with the world’s information. Content is highly personalized – no two people’s web look the same, because each experience is tailored by AI to their needs and tastes. This world is efficient and hyper-optimized. You can accomplish tasks in seconds that used to take hours. However, it is also a world where power is concentrated: whoever provides the dominant AI agents and algorithms wields enormous influence (much like how Facebook or Google did in the Web 2.0 era, but even more directly). There’s also a loss of agency in a different sense – humans might become passive consumers, with the AI making many choices for them. Proponents say this is just the web evolving to better serve us, while critics worry about an “algorithmic bubble” where AI mediates and potentially manipulates every interaction.
- Vision B: The Human-Centric (or Decentralized) Web – This vision is a response to the fears of the first. Here, technology is used to empower individual users and communities, rather than replace their agency. Decentralization from the Web3 movement plays a big role: users control their data and identity via blockchain or other distributed systems, reducing reliance on big gatekeepers. AI still exists, but in this vision it’s user-owned or community-controlled AI, operating transparently. Rather than one of a few mega-agents running your life, you might have smaller, specialized assistants that you can audit or even help train (perhaps your city provides a civic info agent, your local library an AI research assistant, all open-source and accountable). Content in this world might lean heavily back to authentic human voices – potentially supported by micropayments or token economies so that creators don’t need to rely on ads or algorithms. The experience might feel like a revitalization of early Internet communities, but with modern tech: real people in peer-to-peer interaction, using AI as a tool (like a smarter Clippy by your side) rather than an opaque mediator. This web values privacy, transparency, and user choice. Its challenge is usability and scale – it might be harder to achieve the seamless convenience of the AI-centric vision without some trade-offs in centralization. It’s the path of digital self-determination, appealing to those worried about control and authenticity.

Of course, these visions aren’t mutually exclusive. The actual future web may incorporate elements of both. Perhaps we’ll have dominant AI platforms and a thriving decentralized counterculture. Perhaps governments will mandate a bit of Vision B for everyone’s benefit (e.g., requiring data portability and open standards to prevent AI lock-in). For developers, it will be important to watch which way the wind is blowing. If the world leans AI-centric, skills in AI integration, prompt engineering, and working with big platforms will be key. If momentum swings toward decentralization and user empowerment, then knowing cryptographic protocols, federated systems (like Mastodon, for instance), and building for interoperability will be in high demand.

## Conclusion: Navigating an Uncharted Decade

The next ten years will no doubt surprise us. If one thing is clear from the history of the web, it’s that each paradigm shift – from the static documents of Web 1.0, to the participatory Web 2.0, to the decentralized dreams of Web3 – was hard to fully predict even a few years before it happened. We now stand on the brink of another shift, driven by AI’s coming-of-age and a reevaluation of what we want the internet to be.

For web developers and tech-savvy observers, this is a time of both excitement and uncertainty. On one hand, we have powerful new tools (generative models, agent frameworks) to build with, promising to automate drudgery and unlock creativity. On the other, the very role of a “website” or “web app” might transform so fundamentally that we’ll need to reinvent our skillsets. The rise of AI might free us from routine coding, yet present thorny questions about authenticity, security, and ethics online. We might end up writing less JavaScript and more policy files for AI agents; less crafting of pixel-perfect layouts and more tuning of multi-modal experiences that adapt to whoever (or whatever) is consuming them.

As we contemplate the Web of 2035, it helps to keep an open mind. Some of our long-held assumptions will be challenged. But the core principles that have guided the web’s success – interoperability, user empowerment, and open innovation – should remain our north star. If generative AI can be harnessed to enrich content while we put guardrails to prevent the decay of quality, the web will benefit. If autonomous agents can save us time and effort while operating under frameworks of trust and user control, they will be a boon. And if terms like Web 4.0 or Web5 help rally us toward positive progress (rather than just hype), they can serve a purpose in articulating a shared vision.

In the end, the web is ours to shape – a reflection of human and now AI collaborative effort. The next decade will be a grand experiment in co-evolution: we will teach AI about the world, and AI will teach us new ways to organize the world’s information. By 2035, perhaps browsing the web will feel like conversing with a wise guide, or wandering through an infinite mixed-reality library, or delegating errands to an army of digital helpers. However it feels, let’s hope it still feels empowering. The web has always broken down barriers – geographical, cultural, intellectual – to bring knowledge and connection to billions. If we navigate the coming challenges wisely (with a bit of imagination and vigilance), the web ten years from now could be more inclusive, useful, and yes, even more magical than ever.

Regardless of what version number we assign to it, the future web will be built by the choices we make today. Here’s to building a web worth dreaming about!
