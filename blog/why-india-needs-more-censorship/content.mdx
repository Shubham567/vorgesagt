Imagine waking up to find the world once again ending—at least according to the Western media. Every time India makes headlines, the narrative seems eerily familiar: democracy is collapsing, minorities are in peril, or we're somehow on the brink of communal disaster. Cue the dramatic music! But wait—is this really about concern, or is there something more sinister lurking behind these narratives?

Let's start with the champions of global morality: our beloved friends in the West, whose preaching conveniently omits their own messy reality. Consider the United States, that paragon of democracy—where racial inequality and gun violence are as American as apple pie. How quickly they lecture India on human rights while overlooking their overflowing prisons, filled disproportionately with minorities. But who’s counting, right? Maybe we should, though—after all, counting is something we're particularly good at. Ask Aryabhata!

And then there's Britain, historically the grandmaster of colonial loot. Over two centuries, they siphoned an estimated $45 trillion out of India, leaving behind railways not out of generosity, but for easier exploitation. Fast forward today, and the BBC suddenly remembers morality, airing documentaries questioning India’s integrity, conveniently ignoring how they built their empire on exactly the principles they criticize now. Irony, anyone?

Social media amplifies this hypocrisy, providing the perfect stage for sensationalism. Remember The New York Times cartoon? India launches a space mission, and their first instinct is to ridicule—a villager and a cow knocking on the door of the elite space club. Perhaps next time we launch a satellite, we should ask permission first. Would that satisfy their colonial nostalgia?

But jokes aside, social media isn't just about fighting stereotypes. It’s a battleground where misinformation can spark riots overnight. Remember the Nagpur riots? A few false WhatsApp messages and Twitter posts later, communal tensions erupted, leaving communities shattered and the nation questioning how things escalated so quickly. Clearly, something needs to change—and fast. Intrigued? You should be.

Here's a thought: India needs better censorship—but wait, before you scream “attack on free speech,” hear this out. Free speech doesn’t mean freedom from consequences, especially when it's weaponized. Peer-to-peer conversations aren’t the issue; mass-scale misinformation and hate speech are. India must regulate this, carefully distinguishing genuine dissent from orchestrated misinformation. Can we navigate this tightrope? Well, we've survived tougher situations, like colonialism and emergency rule. This should be manageable.

Critically, safeguards are essential. We don’t want censorship misused to silence dissenting voices or independent journalism. India, after all, is famously argumentative and rightfully proud of its pluralistic, democratic spirit. Ensuring transparency, judicial oversight, and strict definitions for misinformation can help prevent abuse. And perhaps, occasionally, we should remind the West about their role in spreading misinformation about India—historically and today.

Yet, social media doesn't only spread misinformation—it also feeds insecurities. Platforms like Instagram parade an endless highlight reel, leaving millions feeling inadequate, constantly comparing themselves to curated Western lifestyles. Indian youths begin to question their worth, their identity, and their country's relevance. Isn’t it ironic? The West looted India's riches, and now, through the digital lens, they threaten our collective self-esteem. But here's a spoiler: India’s resilience has historically overcome far worse.

Still reading? Good, because here comes the uplifting twist: despite these pressures, Indians are reclaiming their narratives. Hashtags like #SareeTwitter and #MakeInIndia trend, showcasing the diversity and dynamism of Indian culture. Santali youth rediscover pride in their language through social media, reclaiming identities eroded by Western-centric exposure. Now, isn’t that poetic justice?

Ultimately, India doesn’t need Western validation, nor should it tolerate the spread of harmful misinformation unchecked. Better censorship and monitoring, balanced carefully with robust safeguards, aren’t threats to democracy—they're its protectors. So next time someone in the West warns of India’s impending doom, politely remind them we've seen their playbook before. And spoiler alert: we’re still standing.

Stay tuned. India's story is just getting interesting.
