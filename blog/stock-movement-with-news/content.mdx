When news hits the market, stocks move. But have you ever wondered how quickly stock prices adjust, and why some news moves markets instantly while other news takes days to fully reflect? Understanding this can help investors make better-informed decisions.

## Severity vs. Complexity: The Two Factors

Market reactions depend primarily on two things: **severity** and **complexity**.

- **Severity** means how significant or impactful the news is—low severity news slightly affects a company's image or profitability, whereas critical severity news can affect entire industries or the economy.

- **Complexity** is about how easily the news is understood. Simple announcements are quickly grasped by everyone, while highly complex events require deeper analysis.

## Immediate Reaction vs. Full Assimilation

Markets react in two main phases:

1. **Immediate Reaction**: The first rapid price movement right after the news hits.
2. **Full Assimilation**: The time it takes for the market to fully understand and stabilize prices around the new information.

## Immediate Reaction: Seconds to Minutes

When critical news breaks—like an unexpected war, a major company's sudden bankruptcy, or a surprise policy change by the central bank—markets respond almost instantly. Why so fast? Because algorithms and professional traders track key phrases and data, making trades within seconds to minutes.

### Examples:

- **High Severity, Low Complexity**: A major tech CEO unexpectedly resigns—stocks react within 1–5 minutes.
- **Critical Severity, Moderate Complexity**: An unexpected central bank interest rate hike—immediate reaction in seconds to minutes.

Conversely, less critical or less clear news, such as a mildly disappointing quarterly earnings report, might initially cause slower reactions, typically 10–30 minutes or longer.

## Full Assimilation: Hours to Days

While the immediate reaction is rapid, the full assimilation—when the market truly stabilizes—can take much longer, especially with complex and severe news.

Imagine a major geopolitical crisis, like an unexpected conflict outbreak:

- **Immediate Reaction**: Stocks drop sharply within minutes.
- **Full Assimilation**: The full market impact—factoring in international responses, economic sanctions, or disruptions in global trade—takes days or even weeks to fully stabilize.

In simpler situations, like a moderately disappointing quarterly earnings report, the market typically stabilizes within hours. Traders quickly process clear-cut financial data, adjust their valuations, and the price settles within the same trading session.

## Easy-to-Understand Examples

- **Low Severity & Low Complexity**: A small company announces a minor product delay. Stocks slightly move within 30 minutes, settling in 1–2 hours.

- **Moderate Severity & Moderate Complexity**: A popular brand reports earnings slightly below expectations with some unclear reasons. Stocks drop within 10 minutes but stabilize after about 4–8 hours as analysts clarify details.

- **High Severity & High Complexity**: A major tech firm faces a serious regulatory investigation affecting its entire business model. Prices plunge within minutes but take up to a couple of days to fully settle, as investors digest ongoing developments.

- **Critical Severity & Very High Complexity**: A sudden financial crisis or global pandemic declaration immediately shakes markets within seconds to minutes. However, complete market stabilization occurs over days or even weeks due to continuous unfolding developments.

## Why Does Complexity Slow Down Market Stability?

Highly complex news requires deeper analysis. Analysts and investors must assess layers of information—like economic implications, regulatory changes, or international repercussions—before confidently adjusting their positions. Every new insight or update can lead to additional price shifts, extending the stabilization period.

## Conclusion

Markets react fast initially because computers and traders instantly process headlines. But fully understanding and reflecting complex or highly impactful news takes time. Knowing this helps investors set realistic expectations about market volatility and better plan their trading strategies.
